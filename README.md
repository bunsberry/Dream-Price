# Dream Price - track your budgets, achieve your dreams!
### What is it?
An elegant budgets tracker for everyone. You can just use it to understand how much you waste on groceries and coffe or you can add "Dreams" (financial goals) and achieve them. You can also add projects like your car which you want repair and sell for profir or your own hotel, with that you understand how much money the project cost you and how much you got out of it.
### Da history
I started this project as a project for hackaton when I was 16, maybe it'll become something one day.
### When is it gonna be on AppStore?
As soon as I'll turn 18, you can wait for it summer 2022.
